        <h3>Go Green</h3>
        <p>As one of the nation's fastest growing web hosting providers, we believe in the importance of letting our clients understand our commitment to eco-friendly policies. Since 2010, we have made a concentrated effort to improve our carbon footprint in our data centers. Similarly, we have made efforts in our offices to reduce waste, increase recycling and stop the use of paper products whenever possible.</p>
        <p>One of our core beliefs is that it's better to reduce than to simply offset, especially when it comes to energy consumption. It's a fact that large data centers are necessary to the operation of any web hosting company. It's also a fact that most data centers consume large amounts of energy and that more than half of that energy is utilized for cooling and air conditioning. That's why we've opened up the first-ever Green Data Center in Los Angeles, CA! By utilizing advanced Outside Air Cooling technology, we're cutting our cooling costs by nearly 70% and reducing our carbon output by more than 2,000 tons per year.</p>
        <p>Traditional data centers run Computer Room Air Conditioners (CRACs) nonstop, cooling the hot air generated by the servers and recirculating it. Outside Air Cooling, instead, vents hot air out of the building entirely and brings cooler air in, only cooling it through the CRAC units when high outside temperatures or humidity makes it necessary. This new technology greatly reduces the energy consumed by the data center for cooling purposes. We're very excited to be the first data center in the Los Angeles area to utilize this green cooling method.</p>

        <p>InMotion Hosting has also partnered with <a href="http://www.treesforthefuture.org/">Trees For The Future</a>, a non-profit organization dedicated to sustainable agroforestry. Through our partnership, InMotion Hosting is providing for the planting of 5,000 trees throughout the developing world. It's part of our overall eco-strategy, which calls for us to reduce our own consumption of resources while providing for the replacement and renewal of existing resources. Moreover, it's a strategy we're proud to pursue every day of the year, not just on Earth Day.</p>
